# Introduction

The Tufte-\LaTeX\ [^tufte_latex] document classes define a style similar to the style Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte's style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. 

# Headings

This style provides a- and b-heads (that is, `#` and `##`), demonstrated above.
An error is emitted if you try to use `###` and smaller headings.

\newthought{In his later books}[^books_be], Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and sets the first few words of the sentence in small caps. To accomplish this using this style, use the `\newthought` command as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph.


## Equations

You can also include \LaTeX\ equations in the margin by explicitly invoking the `marginfigure` environment.

\begin{marginfigure}
$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
\caption{An equation}
\end{marginfigure}

Note the use of the `\caption` command to add additional text below the equation.


# Tables

You can use the **xtable** package to format \LaTeX\ tables that integrate well with the rest of the Tufte handout style. Note that it's important to set the `xtable.comment` and `xtable.booktabs` options as shown below to ensure the table is formatted correctly for inclusion in the document.

```{r, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
options(xtable.booktabs = TRUE)
xtable(head(mtcars[,1:6]), caption = "First rows of mtcars")
```
